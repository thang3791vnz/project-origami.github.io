                    <p class="ptext"> Paper is a thin nonwoven material traditionally made from a combination of milled plant and textile fibres.
                        It is primarily used for writing, artwork, and packaging; it is commonly white.
                        The first papermaking process was documented in China during the Eastern Han period (25–220 AD) traditionally attributed to the court official Cai Lun.
                        During the 8th century, Chinese papermaking spread to the Islamic world, where pulp mills and paper mills were used for papermaking and money making.
                        By the 11th century, papermaking was brought to Europe.
                        By the 13th century, papermaking was refined with paper mills utilizing waterwheels in Spain.
                        Later European improvements to the papermaking process came in the 19th century with the invention of wood-based papers.
                        Although precursors such as papyrus and amate existed in the Mediterranean world and pre-Columbian Americas, respectively, these materials are not defined as true paper.

                        predates paper and possibly papyrus. In the twentieth century with the advent of plastic manufacture some plastic "paper"
                        was introduced, as well as paper-plastic laminates, paper-metal laminates,
                        and papers infused or coated with different products that give them special properties.

                        Actually, very little is known about the origin of the Origami figures at present.
                        There are a few suggestions that they originated in China 2000 years ago, but actually this does not seem correct.
                        Because this view is suggested by the idea that Origami was born after paper,
                        but there is no evidence to confirm this either.
                        And the sheets of 後 漢 didn't show Origami's shape.
                    </p>
                    <p class="ptext">Distinct paperfolding traditions arose in Europe, China, and Japan which have been well-documented by historians.
                        These seem to have been mostly separate traditions, until the 20th century.</p>

                        The first Japanese origami dates from this period and was used for religious ceremonial purposes only,
                        due to the high price of paper.</p>

                                    which mentions a traditional butterfly design used during Shinto weddings.
                                    Folding filled some ceremonial functions in Edo period Japanese culture;
                                    noshi were attached to gifts, much like greeting cards are used today. This developed into a form of entertainment;
                                    the first two instructional books published in Japan are clearly recreational.
                                </p>
                                <P class="ptext">Origami was included in the manners of the samurai class which was passed down by the Houses of Ogasawara,
                                    Ise, Imagawa, and others. Ocho Mecho, as well as Noshi, is an example of this ceremonial origami.
                                    There are many folding patterns for many purposes.
                                    According to Ise Sadatake's "Tsutsumi-no Ki" (1764,) such origami originated in Muromachi era.

                                                <p class="ptext">In Japan, the papers used to wrap gifts are called "tato" or "tatogami", and today Japanese people often use them to wrap kimonos. This work has been traced back to the Heian period. But they also cannot confirm that they are the forerunners of Origami, but because the folded shapes are just simple squares.
                                                    In addition, in this period Japanese people used "hitogata" paper dolls and "heisoku" or "shide" plaid paper in a ritual called Shinto that has a very ancient origin. But those things in the past in Japan were never made of paper and even now, dolls are not required to be made of paper. Therefore, being able to see this has nothing to do with Origami's origin.
                                                    If I used the word Origami in Heian period in Japan, then this word would not be purely and simply folded. Origami is a piece of paper with the picture of a landscape on one side, a white side and is written with poetry, letters .... And in Japan right now, the word "Origami-tsuki" means authentic. The word Origami has been used in Japan since the Showa period. The word Origami is called "orikata" or "orisue" in the Edo period, "orimono" and early Showa period in the late Edo period.

                                                            It reads: "Rosei-ga yume-no cho-wa orisue" - the butterflies in Rosei's dream would be origami.</p>
                                                        <p class="ptext">The reference here is to an origami model called Ocho Meccho (male and female butterflies) which even today are used to wrap sake bottles at Shinto wedding ceremonies. How far these models date back is unclear, but there is some evidence that as long ago as the Heian Period (794-1185) this fold was being used.
                                                            Whatever the precise date, ocho and meccho are historically important because they are the first known examples of representational origami, the forerunners of the ubiquitous origami crane which is the symbol of modern origami.

                                                        This contained instructions to fold 13 ceremonial folds.
                                                        Then, in 1797 'Sembazuru Orikata' - Folding of 1,000 cranes (image, right) - is considered to be the first book documenting recreational paper folding to be published, offering instructions on how to fold multiple interconnecting cranes from a single piece of paper, cut into smaller squares and connected at the corners.

                                    We can recognize a picture in the 1490 edition of "Tractatus de Sphaera Mundi,"
                                    which was written by Johannes de Sacrobosco (John of Holywood) in 13th century and printed over 60 times through the middle of 17th century,
                                    to be the same as that of Boat in "Ramma Zushiki." If it is really an origami boat,
                                    it is unlikely to have descended from Japan, since Japanese origami at that time would be ceremonial one if any.

                                                        In 17th century napkin folding became extremely popular amongst the more well to do of European society, spreading from the courts of Italy to northern Europe. Increasingly elaborate folds were designed to create showy table decorations in the form of animals, birds, sailing ships and other impressive objects. These were created by joining many napkins together, but in his book of these elaborate table settings published in 1629, Matthew Geiger, included a few designs for the folding of individual napkins, of the sort that you might see at a restaurant today.

                                                Origami was called "papierfalten" in German and "paper folding" in English.
                                                When Japan imported Fröbelian origami, they were translated to "shoshi," "tatamigami," or "kamitatami" at the kindergarten, and to "origami-zaiku" or "origami" at the primary schools.

                                often make variations or even improvise new models. This creativity of traditional origami was one of the reason

                            is based on the completely different paradigm. The folding sequences of modern origami are regarded as
                            "models" "designed" by "origami creators."

                                The idea that particular persons have intellectual property in folding sequences is typical of modern origami.

                            <p class="ptext">In modern origami, the creativity is attributed to the designers, and the appreciation to the folders.
                                They prefer the models which have not only good final shapes but also good sequences.
                                In addition, they put importance on reproducibility of the model, that is,
                                folders are supposed to make the same shape as intended by the designer.

                                The diagrams, which represent the folding sequence of a model, are important in modern origami,
                                as they represent the model itself. They are supposed to show the entire sequence. We have similar kind of representation in Japanese classic origami, but they did not describe the entire sequence.

                                Behind the rule, there is an implicit premise that origami models should be folded with origami paper.
                                They make a point of easiness of origami, that is, we need nothing but origami paper to do origami.
                                Thus, a model made of more than one sheet of paper is regarded as good when it is made of sheets in the same size and can be assembled without glue.

                                                Action origami includes origami that flies, requires inflation to complete, or, when complete,
                                                uses the kinetic energy of a person's hands, applied at a certain region on the model, to move another flap or limb. Some argue that, strictly speaking, only the latter is really "recognized" as action origami. Action origami, first appearing with the traditional Japanese flapping bird, is quite common. One example is Robert Lang's instrumentalists; when the figures' heads are pulled away from their bodies, their hands will move, resembling the playing of music.

                                        Modular origami consists of putting a number of identical pieces together to form a complete model.
                                        Normally the individual pieces are simple but the final assembly may be tricky.
                                        Many of the modular origami models are decorative balls like kusudama,
                                        the technique differs though in that kusudama allows the pieces to be put together using thread or glue.
                                        Chinese paper folding includes a style called Golden Venture Folding where large numbers of pieces are put together to make elaborate models. This style originated from some Chinese refugees while they were detained in America.

                                        Wet-folding is an origami technique for producing models with gentle curves rather than geometric straight folds and
                                        flat surfaces. The paper is dampened so it can be moulded easily, the final model keeps its shape when it dries.
                                        It can be used, for instance, to produce very natural looking animal models. Size,
                                        an adhesive that is crisp and hard when dry, but dissolves in water when wet and becoming soft and flexible,
                                        is often applied to the paper either at the pulp stage while the paper is being formed, or on the surface of a ready sheet of paper. The latter method is called external sizing and most commonly uses Methylcellulose, or MC, paste, or various plant starches.

                            Currently, Origami has become a culture, an art in Japan.
                            The details are much more subtle and complex to bring about more complex shapes such as the phoenix,
                            the dragon or the Eiffel Tower. When folding origami,
                            people can also use metal foil to reduce the breakage of shapes that require multiple folds.
                            At present, Origami has also changed a lot, not only ordinary paper, but also wet paper and metal.
                            Origami in Japan is seen as a part of traditional culture rather than an art form.
